Stoke Row Independent Chapel

### Stoke Row Independent Chapel was built in 1815 and there is a history of [Dissenters][0] meeting in the village. 

[][1]Dissenters had been meeting in the village since 1691, when they gathered in the drawing room of a local farmhouse. The Chapel was built in [Flemish bond][2][red brick][3] on [flint][4]footings. The roof is [slate][5]hipped with overhanging eaves.

In the early years services were conducted by visiting ministers or licensed [lay preachers][6], but in 1955 a wealthy local farmer, who had been a lifelong strong supporter, bequeathed a large piece of land opposite the chapel and on this houses were built.\[_[][7]_

The resulting finance enabled a house to be built for the Minister and for chapel modernisation, including modern heating and the provision of a kitchen and toilets. A trust was also established and this still provides for the upkeep of the exterior of both buildings.

In 1978 Padre Bernard Railton Bax took over the ministry. His work was continued, after his death in 1990, by Rev John Harrington and his wife Nina. Mrs Harrington died in 1996 and Rev Harrington retired at the age of 87, after thirteen years of service.

The chapel has always been independent, but it has neighbourly links with the local[Church of England][8] parish church of St John the Evangelist. There was once a move to integrate with the [Congregational Church][9], but the plan did not materialise.\[

The chapel has an [ecumenical][10]attitude and residential Ministers in recent years have included a [Baptist][11]and several from a [United Reformed Church][12] background.

Today the Chapel has a congregation of about 80 members and around 35 attend regularly. The chapel choir sings every week. A Sunday School thrived until quite recently. 

Since Rev Harrington retired, Rev David Holmwood and his wife Trish have served the chapel. The [Salvation Army][13] and other charities provide lay speakers once a month. The current ministers are Revs David and Sonia Jackson.

In June 2015 an outdoor service was held, attended by many villagers, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the chapel. The congregation sat in a marquee in the chapel grounds and sang hymns with accompaniment from the Reading Central Salvation Army Band. Rev David and Rev Sonya Jackson gave readings and led prayers, as did Rev Kevin Davies, the minister for Henley deanery. The service was followed by a village picnic. A celebration cake was cut by 95-year-old Ken Jago, the oldest member of the congregation.
